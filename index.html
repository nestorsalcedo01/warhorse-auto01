                modelAnswer: "Albert's mother explained that Farmer Easton was bidding for the horse[cite: 66].

                modelAnswer: "No, Joey did not willingly abandon Topthorn when he died, even amidst heavy shelling. He 'would not abandon him'[cite: 1023]. Despite Friedrich's attempts to drag him away to safety, Joey 'did not want to go'[cite: 1025]. He stood by Topthorn and Friedrich 'all that day and into the night,' and his fear was 'overwhelmed by a powerful sense of sadness and love that compelled me to stay with Topthorn for as long as I could'[cite: 1031, 1033]. He was 'still licking and nuzzling him where he lay' in his grief[cite: 993]." // Note: This citation for licking/nuzzling is from the immediate aftermath, before Friedrich's attempts to move him during shelling.

He was described as a 'small, helmeted figure in a flapping khaki greatcoat' [cite: 1106] and a 'small man in khaki... his face red and still smooth with youth, his round helmet... fallen askew'[cite: 1119]. The German soldier referred to him as 'Welshman'[cite: 1160], and the Welshman used the term 'boyo'[cite: 1115], but there is no indication he held an officer's rank. His interactions and speech suggest a common soldier."

The definitive recognition came when Albert untied Joey, walked away, and then used 'his owl whistle,' the same call from the farm.
